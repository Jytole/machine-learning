# Machine Learning and Soft Computing

This repository contains the files written by Kyler Smith as a part of Dr. Shahram Rahimi's Machine Learning course taught in the Fall of 2023.

## Projects

### Assignment 5.5

Assignment 5.5 was intended to generate a solution to an equation optimization problem using a genetic algorithm. It operates using a python command line package, and thus accepts a number of parameters to make testing easier. Example execution commands are available in the beginning comments.

This assignment was scored a 9/10 due to not submitting proof of three different runs of the program.

### Assignment 6

Assignment 6 was intended to generate a solution to the maintenance scheduling problem using a genetic algorithm. It also operates using the same python command line package, and accepts the same parameters.

This assignment was a bonus assignment and was scored a 10/10.

### Final Project

This folder contains files included in a submission for the final project written by Kyler Smith and Cassie Javorsky. The paper has not yet been published as of December 2023, but it is intended to propose a solution to the problem of condition-based maintenance using The Bees Algorithm. The folder contains python files written with a naive prediction and optimization function, but work as a proof of concept for adapting The Bees Algorithm's python library to a custom dataset.

A readme document within this folder contains further information and instructions for program execution and dependencies.

This assignment and associated presentation were together scored a 21/20.
